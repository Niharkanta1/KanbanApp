# KanbanApp

This application was created using Spring-boot and Angular UI. KanbanApp is a Trello-Like, a web-based, Kanban-style, list-making application and is developed by me, and it is heavily inspired from https://trello.com/
This is created for personal use and learning purposes. Never intended for commercial use.
